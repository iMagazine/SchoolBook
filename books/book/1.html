	<h3>At Peace</h3>
		<p>
			In the old days, in peaceful times between the big wars, lived an honest man, Otto Frank, with his wife, Edith and two daughters, Anne and Margot. They lived in a house much like the house you live in now, in a land not far from you. Otto loved to read, he had a built up a great library of books and encouraged his daughters to read too. Anne, the youngest daughter was only three but liked to flick through the pages of her Dad's books, looking for pictures and words she could understand. The Frank family were Jewish people who had 1000s of years of heritage and culture, whose history was passed down as stories from parents to children. Stories of defending themselves against those who wanted to hurt them. They were an ancient, proud people who worked hard and helped out their friends and neighbours.

  <p>
	  Before Anne was old enough to understand the things on the news, Otto was worried when he found out that a gang of angry men had come to power in their home town. They were led by a twisted Evil Lord who hated Jewish people like Otto and his family. At first, after this gang came to power, nothing much changed. Then week by week, things got worse and worse for the Frank family and other Jews. There were attacks on Otto's friends and families' houses and shops. After a few weeks of these attacks, the time had come where it was no longer safe for Otto, Anne and the rest of the family to live in their own home town. Otto and his wife decided to move their daughters out of town, somewhere safe.
  </p>
		<p>
			And so the Frank family moved on. They travelled miles and miles, to a land so flat you could see forever and to a magical city they found that was full of canals - man made rivers - where people would step out of their front door, step into a boat and go to school or work on the water, instead of walking on the street. It was a beautiful country and a wonderful city and most importantly, it was a long way away from The Evil Lord and his gangs of angry men. So they settled here, in the city with the waterways for streets, cobbled pavements and lots and lots of bikes everywhere. Anne was only four and here she had a chance to mix with all the local children and make lots of friends in her new home.

			The years went by and life went on... Anne grew a little taller, her Mum and Dad grew a little bit older and her older sister Margot... grew a little taller and older. Otto started a company, selling fruit, herbs and spices, Anne loved studying, she worked hard at her schoolwork and liked hanging out with her friends: they were all happy in their new city... Back in their old home town, The Evil Lord had grown very powerful. He had more men joining his gangs and almost all of Anne's home country under his control. But that was OK, the Frank family were in their new home, a country far away where he could not harm them.
		</p>
		<p>
			But he was scheming, The Evil Lord, and he was full of hate. His plans grew more ambitious and daring, he wanted more towns and countries under his control and he wanted to drive the Frank family and other Jewish families like theirs into the sea. Whilst people and families went about their daily business he planned to attack all the countries in the land, including where the Frank family now lived. He planned terrible, terrible things. But no one could see what was coming.
