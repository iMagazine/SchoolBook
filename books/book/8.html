			<h1> Chapter 6 </h1>  <h2>The Liberation... </h2>
			
			<p>
				Unknown to Anne and Margot, the Evil Emperor's enemies, "The Alliance", had been busy planning to destroy him and his men. Whilst Anne and her family spent years hiding in the secret house, The Alliance were building up their armies with men and weapons to fight the Evil Emperor. While the Frank family were being moved to Camp A, The Alliance started their attack on the Evil Emperor's soldiers. Gigantic battles on the land, in the air and at sea were being fought and the Evil Emperor was losing. More and more of the countries he had invaded were being won back by The Alliance who were liberating the people, that is making them free again. The Alliance were driving further and further into the continent, destroying more and more of the Evil Emperors soldiers and were soon close to Camp B where they could liberate all the people who had been imprisoned there. 
			</p>
			<p>

				The Alliance soldiers finally beat the Evil Emperor's soldiers who were guarding Camp B and they could not believe what they saw. Thousands of dead people lying in giant graves, with thousands more ill and starving people who were close to death themselves. The Alliance gave these poor people food, water and medical care else they too might die. Even though The Alliance tried to get to the camps as quickly as possible, it was too late for Anne and Margot. 
			</p>
			<p>

				A few weeks before The Alliance liberated Camp B, Margot had caught the bug that was spreading through the camp. She was so ill already she didn't have the strength to fight the disease. She died shortly after. Now Anne, was completely alone, not knowing what had happened to her mother and father and now had lost her sister. She too was ill, starving and shivering with the cold and disease. Anne died a few days after her sister. 
			</p>
			<p>
				She was only 15 years old.
