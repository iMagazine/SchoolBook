    <h3>Anne's Diary</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="firstcharacter">Y</span>ou might be wondering how we know so much about the Frank family as their story is so secret? Anne Frank kept a diary. Almost every day Anne would write down what had happened in the secret house or in the outside world that she would hear on the news. She would tell the diary her feelings, her thoughts and what was worrying her. The diary was like a close friend who was always ready to listen but only spoke back what she had already said. That was a good friend to have when you are forced to live in silence, squashed in with seven other people...
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne wrote about her dream of becoming a journalist, she knew that she had to keep up with her schoolwork to stay smart and get ahead in life, even though she, nor any of the other children in the secret house, actually went to school anymore. She knew she wanted to be more than her mother and the other women, who she thought just went about her work and were then forgotten. Anne had ambitions and dreams and she knew she had to study hard to make her ambitions come true.

      Summer passed into Autumn. And Autumn into Winter. Winter into Spring. And Spring back into Summer. All this time, Anne, Otto and the others were living secret, quiet lives in the house above the offices. Over two whole years passed with them never leaving the secret house. Hidden upstairs among the 3 floors and 4 rooms and the attic. It was a tough time to live through but it was better than what would happen to them if they were caught by the Evil Emperor and his men...
